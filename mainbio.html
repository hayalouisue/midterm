      <h2 id="Childhood"><u>Childhood</u></h2>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My childhood was a time that really shaped who I am today.<sup>1</sup> It’s when I met some of my closest friends, like Jeremiah, Sean, Von, and Vic.<sup>2</sup> I was around four years old when I first started going outside to play with the kids in my neighborhood.<sup>3</sup> We would often hang out at Sean’s house and spend hours playing Minecraft, having fun and just being kids.<sup>4</sup> Those days were simple, but they were full of laughter and good memories.<sup>5</sup> We would ride bikes around the streets and play tag until we were out of breath.<sup>6</sup> Sometimes we would even play hide and seek in the vacant lot, trying to find the best hiding spots.<sup>7</sup> At the time, we didn’t have any worries or responsibilities, and life was carefree.<sup>8</sup> I loved those moments of just being a kid, not having to think about anything else.<sup>9</sup> Along with my friends, my family played a huge role in shaping my childhood.<sup>10</sup> My parents taught me many lessons, both big and small, that I still carry with me.<sup>11</sup> One thing I remember is cleaning the house every morning, something my family made a routine.<sup>12</sup> It wasn’t just about keeping things clean, but about building responsibility and respect.<sup>13</sup> My family also shared their love for music with me.<sup>14</sup> We listened to old songs that taught me about different cultures and the past.<sup>15</sup> I learned to appreciate different kinds of music, from r&b to classic opm.<sup>16</sup> Those songs are still something I enjoy today, and they remind me of my childhood.<sup>17</sup> The way my family showed love and care made me value the small things in life.<sup>18</sup> I remember family dinners where we’d talk about our day, sharing everything that happened.<sup>19</sup> Those simple moments with my family and friends created a strong foundation for who I am now.<sup>20</sup> Looking back, I am so grateful for my childhood and the lessons it taught me.<sup>21</sup></p>
        
      <h2 id="skills"><u>Teenage</u></h2>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teenage years were the most fun and memorable part of my life, filled with so many emotions and experiences.<sup>1</sup> It’s when I had my first everything, including falling in love with basketball.<sup>2</sup> I remember the first time I picked up a basketball, I didn’t know much about the game, but I quickly became hooked.<sup>3</sup> I made a lot of friends who played basketball with me, and we spent a lot of time together.<sup>4</sup> We would practice for hours, improving our skills and having fun while doing it.<sup>5</sup> Basketball became more than just a game to me, it became a way to bond with friends and stay active.<sup>6</sup> I joined a lot of basketball tournaments during my teenage years, and each one was an exciting experience.<sup>7</sup> I loved the feeling of competing and playing on a team.<sup>8</sup> I also had my first love life experiences, which were exciting and taught me a lot.<sup>9</sup> I learned what it was like to have feelings for someone and what it meant to be in a relationship.<sup>10</sup> I made some mistakes, but I also had some good memories that I cherish.<sup>11</sup> I was always outgoing, having fun with my friends at school, and we did everything together.<sup>12</sup> We would hang out after school, go to the mall, or just chill at someone’s house.<sup>13</sup> Those years were carefree and full of energy.<sup>14</sup> It felt like every day brought something new and exciting.<sup>15</sup> I remember going on school trips and feeling so free, exploring new places with my friends.<sup>16</sup> Those moments were unforgettable.<sup>17</sup> Looking back, I do feel a little sad that I didn’t enjoy it all because of the pandemic.<sup>18</sup> When everything shut down, it felt like the fun stopped, and we missed out on so many things.<sup>19</sup> Plus, I’ve lost touch with many of my high school friends since we’ve all gotten busy with college and adult life.<sup>20</sup> It’s hard not seeing them as much, but I’ll always remember the good times we had.<sup>21</sup> Still, those teenage years were some of the best times I’ve had, and I wouldn’t trade those memories for anything.<sup>22</sup></p>

      <h2 id="college"><u>College</u></h2>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;College life has been tough and, to be honest, a bit depressing.<sup>1</sup> It feels like all I do is go to university, head home, and repeat the same routine.<sup>2</sup> Every day seems like the same cycle, and it’s hard to break out of it.<sup>3</sup> I miss being a teenager, when there wasn’t as much pressure and adult responsibilities to deal with.<sup>4</sup> Back then, life felt more relaxed, and I could enjoy my time without constantly worrying about assignments, bills, or the future.<sup>5</sup> Right now, I’m still figuring it all out, trying to find a balance between school, work, and personal life.<sup>6</sup> It’s overwhelming sometimes, but I know that better days will come.<sup>7</sup> I have to remind myself to stay patient and keep pushing forward, even when things feel like they’re not going as planned.<sup>8</sup> I know that with time, things will get easier.<sup>9</sup> I just have to trust God and believe that everything will work out.<sup>10</sup> Luckily, I have some great friends who make college life more bearable.<sup>11</sup> Without them, I’m not sure how I’d manage.<sup>12</sup> They’re always there to remind me of what I need to do and how to keep going, even when I feel lost.<sup>13</sup> We help each other out, whether it’s with studying, work, or just talking through our problems.<sup>14</sup> Having them around makes the whole college experience a little less stressful.<sup>15</sup> It’s nice to know that I’m not alone in this journey.<sup>16</sup> Despite the challenges, I try to stay optimistic about the future. I know that this phase of life is just temporary, and I have the strength to get through it.<sup>17</sup> I’m excited for what comes next and the lessons I’ll learn along the way.<sup>18</sup> I believe that I just have to keep pushing through, no matter how hard it gets.<sup>19</sup> Eventually, things will fall into place, and I’ll look back on this time with a sense of pride.<sup>20</sup></p>
